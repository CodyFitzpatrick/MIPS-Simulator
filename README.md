MIPS-Simulator
==============

MIPS Simulator in C++ for a University of Florida course, CDA3101 ("Computer Organization").

The program takes in the input file (e.g. sample.txt), MIPS instructions in binary format separated by new lines, at the command line upon running the compiled program.
It outputs a disassembly.txt and simulation.txt file, showing the contents of the memory registers upon program initialization and the MIPS instruction(s) execution, respectively.

Please note that this program requires your compiler to be familiar with C++11.
